The Cosmic Background Bufferbloat Detector

This is currently:

An attempt to leverage the ntp protocol to detect bufferbloat by measuring the difference between origin and destination timestamps, over time, over large sample sets of the sparse data generated by the low level of ntp background information.

See the TODO.org for what remains to be done.
